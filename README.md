This app uses web3 technology and metamask to communicate with the moralis cloud!
In order to use, must have metamask installed.
When clicking "Moralis login",
the app will open up the metamask chrome extension for you to "sign" for Moralis Authentication.
Click f12 to view the console and see the info that is logged!
It will show transactions of the user,
which can be viewed from my moralis dashboard.
Moralis is currently connected to the Ethereum Mainnet!
